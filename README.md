# Scientific Visualization
This repository contains a collection of useful Paraview skills for scientific visualization that I've developed and condensed into one place.
I've made generous use of the default Mac OS keyboard shortcuts in this collection for brevity.
If you are using a different operating system, the corresponding shortcuts can easily be found via a quick Google search.
I've also assumed that anyone using this collection has the most recent version of Paraview.
