# Contributing Guidelines
The following guidelines ensure uniformity of the resources in this repository.

- Filenames, filter names, terminal commands, and terminal command options should be wrapped with \`'s, ie. \`\<item\>\`

- When possible, screenshots should be made using Â "Capture selected window," or whatever your screenshotting  tool uses.
[Three Steps to Nicer Visualization](Tutorials/three-steps-to-nice-visualization.md) provides a good example of this.

- Paraview dark mode is strongly preferred.

- Black or white backgrounds should be used in all screenshots (no Paraview default background color please)

- Boxes with 3pt borders and an RGB value of (255,0,0) should be used to highlight regions in screenshots

- Screenshots should be placed in `Resources/<tutorial-name>` and named `A.png`, `B.png`, etc.
